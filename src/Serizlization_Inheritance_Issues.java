/**
 * If a superclass is Serializable, then according to normal Java interface
 * rules, all subclasses of that class automatically implement Serializable
 * implicitly.
 * 
 * In other words, a subclass of a class marked Serializable passes the IS-A
 * test for Serializable, and thus can be saved without having to explicitly
 * mark the subclass as Serializable.
 * 
 * You simply cannot tell whether a class is or is not Serializable UNLESS you
 * can see the class inheritance tree to see if any other superclasses implement
 * Serializable.
 * 
 * If the class does not explicitly extend any other class, and does not
 * implement Serializable, then you know for CERTAIN that the class is not
 * Serializable, because class Object does NOT implement Serializable.
 *

 * Desc:

 * 
 * <pre>
 *  Now you have a Serializable Dog class, with a non-Serializable superclass. This 
 * works! But there are potentially serious implications. 
 * 
 * To fully understand those 
 * implications, let's step back and look at the difference between an object that comes 
 * from deserialization vs. an object created using new. 
 * 
 * Remember, when an object 
 * is constructed using new (as opposed to being deserialized), the following things 
 * happen (in this order):
 * 
 *  1.  All instance variables are assigned default values.
 *  
 *  2.  The constructor is invoked, which immediately invokes the superclass  
 *   constructor (or another overloaded constructor, until one of the overloaded
 *   constructors invokes the superclass constructor).
 *   
 *  3.  All superclass constructors complete.
 *  
 *  4.  Instance variables that are initialized as part of their declaration are assigned 
 *   their initial value (as opposed to the default values they're given prior to 
 *   the superclass constructors completing).
 *   
 *  5.  The constructor completes.
 * But these things do NOT happen when an object is deserialized. When an instance of
