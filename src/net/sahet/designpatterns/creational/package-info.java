 * Creational Patterns are designed to deal with how to create object.

 * {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern} In software
 * engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with
 * object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to
 * the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design
 * problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns
 * solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
