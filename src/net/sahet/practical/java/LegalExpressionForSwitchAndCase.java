/**
 * Legal Expressions for switch and case The general form of the switch
 * statement is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * switch (expression) {
 *   case constant1: code block
 *   case constant2: code block
 *   default: code block
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * A switch's expression must evaluate to a char, byte, short, int, or, as of Java 
 * 6, an enum, Java 7 String.  That means if you're not using an enum, only variables and values 
 * that can be automatically promoted (in other words, implicitly cast) to an int are 
 * acceptable. You won't be able to compile if you use anything else, including the 
 * remaining numeric types of long, float, and double.
 * 
 * 
 * A case constant must evaluate to the same type as the switch expression can 
 * use, with one additionalâ€”and bigâ€”constraint: the case constant must be a 
 * compile time constant! Since the case argument has to be resolved at compile 
 * time, that means you can use only a constant or final variable that is assigned a 
 * literal value. It is not enough to be final, it must be a compile time constant. For 
 * example:
 * 
 * 
 * final int a = 1;
 * final int b;
 * b = 2;
 * int x = 0;
 * switch (x) {
 *   case a:     // ok
 *   case b:     // compiler error
 * </pre>
 * 
 */
public class LegalExpressionForSwitchAndCase {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		final int a = 1;
		final int b; /// no compiler time constant
		b = 2;
		int x = 0;
		switch (x) {
		case a: // ok
//		case b: // compiler error
		}

		/*
		 * Also, the switch can only check for equality. This means that the other
		 * relational operators such as greater than are rendered unusable in a case.
		 * The following is an example of a valid expression using a method invocation
		 * in a switch statement. Note that for this code to be legal, the method being
		 * invoked on the object reference must return a value compatible with an int.
		 */
		String s = "xyz";
		switch (s.length()) {
		case 1:
			System.out.println("length is one");
			break;
		case 2:
			System.out.println("length is two");
			break;
		case 3:
			System.out.println("length is three");
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("no match");
		}

		/*
		 * One other rule you might not expect involves the question, "What happens if I
		 * switch on a variable smaller than an int?" Look at the following switch:
		 */
		byte g = 2;
		switch (g) {
		case 23:
			// case 128: //possible loss of precision
		}

		/*
		 * It's also illegal to have more than one case label using the same value. For
		 * example, the following block of code won't compile because it uses two cases
		 * with the same value of 80:
		 */
		int temp = 90;
		switch (temp) {
		case 80:
			System.out.println("80");
			// case 80 : System.out.println("80"); // won't compile! duplicate CASE
		case 90:
			System.out.println("90");
		default:
			System.out.println("default");
		}

		/*
		 * It is legal to leverage the power of boxing in a switch expression. For
		 * instance, the following is legal:
		 */
		switch (new Integer(4)) { // for switch - no need to be compiler-time-constant, but CASE yes
		case 4:
			System.out.println("boxing is OK");
		}

		/*
		 * Look for any violation of the rules for switch and case arguments. For
		 * example, you might ï¬? nd illegal examples like the following snippets:
		 */
		// without COLON
		/*
		 * switch(x) { case 0 { y = 7; } }
		 */
		// without case
		/*
		 * switch(x) { 0: { } 1: { } }
		 */

 * Break and Fall-Through in switch Blocks
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * We're finally ready to discuss the break statement, and more details about flow 
 * control within a switch statement. The most important thing to remember about 
 * the flow of execution through a switch statement is this:
 * case constants are evaluated from the top down, and the first case constant 
 * that matches the switch's expression is the execution entry point.
 * 
 * 
 * In other words, once a case constant is matched, the JVM will execute the 
 * associated code block, and ALL subsequent code blocks (barring a break statement) 
 * too! The following example uses an enum in a case statement.
 * </pre>

		 * Again, when the program encounters the keyword break during the execution of
		 * a switch statement, execution will immediately move out of the switch block
		 * to the next statement after the switch. If break is omitted, the program just

		 * This combination occurs because the code didn't hit a break statement;
		 * execution just kept dropping down through each case until the end. This
		 * dropping down is actually called "fall-through," because of the way execution
		 * falls from one case to the next. Remember, the matching case is simply your
		 * entry point into the switch block! In other words, you must not think of it
		 * as, "Find the matching case, execute just that code, and get out." That's not
