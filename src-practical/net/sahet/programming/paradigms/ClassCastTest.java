/**
 * The new and improved code block contains a cast, which in this case is

 * to a more specific class. Now, the compiler is happy. Before we try to invoke
 * playDead, we cast the animal variable to type Dog. What we're saying to the
 * compiler is, "We know it's really referring to a Dog object, so it's okay to
 * make a new Dog reference variable to refer to that object." In this case
 * we're safe because before we ever try the cast, we do an instanceof test to
 * make sure. It's important to know that the compiler is forced to trust us
 * when we do a downcast, even when we screw up:

 * Unlike downcasting, upcasting (casting up the inheritance tree to a more

 * you can invoke, as opposed to downcasting, which implies that later on, you
